DEMO PROTOTYPE PRD — EXECUTION BRIEF

Four demo beats. Eight screens. One story.

Antigravity — development execution team
Hackathon Domain
Domain 3: Smart Living — Centralized event portal, attendance
tracking, participation history, basic notifications, simple for non-

Version
Demo PRD v1.0 — Stripped to demo essentials only
Screens In Scope
8 screens. Everything the judge sees in 90 seconds.
Screens Out of Scope
Live Control Room, Chat, CV Generator, Emergency Mode, AI Role
Generator, NGO Tiers, Staff Roles, Directory, Search. Full PRD exists
— not built for demo.
Features IN Scope
GPS geofence auto check-in + timer pause/resume · Post limit

---PAGE BREAK---
enforcement · Manual endorsements with quota · DEV simulate
buttons · Anti-scam location guard · Dark mode
Features OUT of Scope
Skill-based For You feed tab · Full social sharing suite (Instagram/
X/PDF) · Private chat · CV generator · Emergency mode · NGO tier
system
Differentiator
GPS geofence auto attendance + active-time tracking + manual
endorsements + engagement reports. No other team will have this.
Pitch Sentence
Other tools track registrations. We track real-world participation —
GPS-verified hours, automatically logged, zero manual NGO input.
🎯 1. The Four Demo Beats
Everything built serves one of these four moments. If a feature
doesn't appear here, it isn't built for demo.
The judge is evaluating Domain 3. They need to see four things.
These four beats are the only acceptance criteria that matters on
demo day.
Beat
Domain 3 Requirement
What the Judge Sees
Screen
Beat 1 Centralized Portal
NGO posts events and collects volunteer registrations

---PAGE BREAK---
NGO creates a drive in under 90 seconds. Drive appears publicly.
Volunteer registers with one tap.
S4 Create Drive → S3 Feed
Beat 2 Attendance Tracking
Automated attendance tracking system
Volunteer walks into the GPS geofence. Check-in fires
automatically. Timer starts. No button pressed. No NGO action
required.
S5 Live Map
Beat 3 Engagement Reports
Generates engagement reports
NGO opens Drive Analytics. Sees every volunteer, their exact active
time in zone, attendance rate, role fill. All automatic.
S7 Analytics
Beat 4 Participation History
Logs participation history
Volunteer sees a performance card: GPS-verified hours, tasks,
endorsements. Shareable. Permanent. On their profile forever.
S6 Profile + S8 Perf Card
Nuclear Differentiator
Beat 2 wins the room. Most teams will build a "Mark Attendance"
button or a QR scan. You will show GPS coordinates updating on
screen, a geofence circle pulsing on the map, and a timer starting
automatically the moment a volunteer steps inside. That is smart
living automation. Lead with it.

Timer Rule
timerSeconds counts ONLY when inZone=true. Pauses (does not
